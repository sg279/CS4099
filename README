Usage instructions for class instantiation and evaluation
Written by Sam Goldberg 12/4/2021
Please see class comments for implementation instructions such as hyper parameter explanations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preprocessing:
Contains a class for converting CBIS-DDSM DICOM images into pngs, extracting metadata, and converting it into a form that can be used for training.
File paths specified in the methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Models:

expert_ensemble:
No training is required for expert (voting and average) ensembles, so after instantiation the model can be evaluated.

ff_ensemble and metadata_nn:
Feed forward ensembles (logistic regression and neural network) and metadata_nn models need to be trained. After instantiation,
call the class's make_model and train methods for evaluation. The metadata_nn model trains only on metadata

base_model, mixed_data:
These models use data generators, so after instantiation, models need to have make_generators, make_model, and train called before evaluation.
Mixed data models include CNN meta learner ensembles, base model and metadata models, and ensemble and metadata models.

Main:

Evaluate:
This method takes a model as a parameter and calls its test_predict method to get predictions on the test data. It then stores various results about the prediciton and an
ROC AUC curve

Scripts:

The code in scripts.py was used only for collecting results and has no impact on the rest of the project
